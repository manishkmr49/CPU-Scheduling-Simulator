# 💻 CPU Scheduling Simulator

The CPU Scheduling Simulator is a web-based application designed to help users understand and compare different CPU scheduling algorithms. With an intuitive user interface, users can input arrival times and burst times of processes and select from various scheduling algorithms to see how each one handles task execution.

## 🌟 Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface for inputting process details and selecting scheduling algorithms.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from various CPU scheduling algorithms, including:
  - 🕒 First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - 🏃‍♂️ Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - ⏳ Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  - 🔄 Round Robin (RR)
- **Interactive Visualization:** Generates an interactive Gantt chart to visualize the scheduling sequence and observe process execution over time.
- **Output Analysis:** Displays detailed output, including:
  - ⏱️ Finish times
  - 🔄 Turnaround times
  - ⏳ Waiting times for each process
  - 📊 Average turnaround and waiting times
- **GitHub Integration:** Includes a link to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/manishkmr49/CPU-Scheduling-Simulator) for easy access to the source code and collaboration.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structuring the web page layout and content.
- **CSS:** Styling the appearance of the web page and components.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing CPU scheduling algorithms and interactivity.
- **jQuery:** Simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **dotLottie:** Integrating Lottie animations for visual appeal.
- **GitHub:** Hosting the project repository for version control and collaboration.
